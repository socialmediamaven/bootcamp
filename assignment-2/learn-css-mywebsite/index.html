<p>Alice is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister. She then notices a talking, clothed White Rabbit with a pocket watch run past.
<p> She follows it down a rabbit hole when suddenly she falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes.
She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it she sees an attractive garden.</p>
<p> She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she has left on the table. </p>
	<p>She eats a cake with "EAT ME" written on it in currants as the chapter closes. Alice is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister.</p>
