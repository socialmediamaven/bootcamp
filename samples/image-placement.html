chapter-05/where-to-place-images.html HTML
Where an image is placed
in the code will affect how it
is displayed. Here are three
examples of image placement
that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.
